Little scripts done in Bash.


* Recomendation
Add the repository to your *PATH* so you can execute scripts from everywhere. 
Here is how!

- Clone the repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ironjanowar/Scripts.git
#+END_SRC

- Add the repository path to your *PATH* variable from /bash/. Open your /.bashrc/ (usually on /home/$USER)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/Scripts
#+END_SRC

- Add to your /bashrc/ (in my case /zshrc/) an alias
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
alias gp="gitPush.sh"
#+END_SRC

- Now you are ready to go! Open a new shell, go into a repository and type:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ gp
#+END_SRC
